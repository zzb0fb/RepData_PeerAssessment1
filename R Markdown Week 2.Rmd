## This is my first R MArkdown file

We are going to load some data

```{r first}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Let's first make a pair plot of the data

```{r second, echo=FALSE}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation and temperature

```{r third}
library(stats)
fit<-lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data=airquality)
summary(fit)
```

Here's a table of regression coeficients

```{r showtable, results='asis'}
library(xtable)
xt<-xtable(summary(fit))
print(xt, type="html")
```
